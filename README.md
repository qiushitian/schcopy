# Copier for the ACP Scheduler Files

An easy snippet of code that copies file under the ACP Scheduler's saved file structure. Works on both Windows and Unix. Supports remote and redirected drives (e.g. `westep`).

Usage: `python [**/]schcopy.py <target name> [<start date (inclusive)>] [<end date (exclusive)>]`

`hist-alt.py` is another snippet of code that outputs information (e.g. altitude, airmass, etc.) about archived observations of (a) specified target(s). It shares some foundation with `schcopy.py` but is independent.
